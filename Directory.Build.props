            AFAIK, NG.Wpf was not designed with NRT in view at the time,
            but there may be a place for the null safety checks here, we'll see;
            I was curious what the scope and impact might be, so I explored the topic,
            and there results were so-so, 50/50, but I did not pursue in any more depth than that. -->
